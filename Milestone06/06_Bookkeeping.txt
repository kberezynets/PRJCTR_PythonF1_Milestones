You were previously uploading homework files directly to the CMS system. Now, that we know git, let's use it!

1. Create a new repository + remote on GitHub. Organize your files in the following structure:

- milestone_1
-- equations.py
- milestone_2
-- encrypt.py
-- decrypt.py
...

2. Commit each milestone with a separate commit.

3. Create a README.md file with the description of the repository and a table of contents (relative link to the folder + name of the milestone).
